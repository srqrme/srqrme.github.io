I made it to my second project! While this project had it's ups and downs, I can honestly say it has been far less painful than I initially imagined. 

The first and fairly daunting (for me, at least) task of this project was actually creating a Sinatra app from scratch. There are quite a few steps to the process. Being the nervous Nancy that I am, just looking at all the steps was disheartening. I watched the video on [how to create the app from scratch](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v6/sinatra/activerecord/video-review-authentication), but that only made me more anxious. 

Thankfully we live in a technology driven world where someone has already written the codes to make this easier for us. 

Here's where the [Corneal gem](http://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/) comes in. I heard about Corneal in various study sessions, but had no idea how powerful it really is. After installing the gem, creating crucial files like a Gemfile and config.ru was an absolute breeze. All I had to do was give it my directory name, cd into the directory, and run bundle install. Voila! The files and folders were created for me. Granted, there were still a few files I had to create myself, but it was mainly the database and app folders that I knew I had to create on my own anyway. If you're worried about not knowing where to start, I would highly suggest looking into the Corneal gem as an option. You won't be disappointed, I promise.

Here's a link to my demonstration video. I hope you enjoy!
