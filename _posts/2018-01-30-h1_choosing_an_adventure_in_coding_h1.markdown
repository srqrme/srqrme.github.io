Growing up in an era of rapidly advancing technologies and applications, I always knew that I wanted to make my mark in that world. 

I was only 12 years old when I was first introduced to the world of coding through a popular (during its time) blogging website, Xanga. Even though I was so young, I was fascinated by the all of the possibilities that came with creating my own webpage. Rather than copying and pasting templates like everyone else I knew, I began conducting my own research into coding and building websites. I was able to teach myself some basic coding to use towards my page. Equipped with just the knowledge of basic coding, I was able to customize my site to fit my exact personality or mood at the time. I quickly realized that developing webpages was, in a sense, like creating a piece of art. As the developer, I was an artist and codes were my paintbrushes. 

Until recently, I had been working as a program coordinator for a pharmaceutical company. Though the duties and responsibilities of my position were fine, I knew I wanted more. As the company’s business grew, so did the need for new portal websites and systems for our new clients. Since my job was to monitor our clients as they used these portals and systems, I wanted to learn everything I could. I needed to know how these sites and portals were created, why some parts worked and others didn’t, and also how things could be fixed if necessary. Having this information wasn’t pertinent to my position, but I was certain that it would help me in the future. I began working closely with the company’s IT department where I was re-introduced to coding. Again, I was amazed at the infinite ways a website could be changed through just a few short codes. 

To this day, I am still fascinated by the language of coding. Not only can can it create visually stunning websites, but coding can be used to build applications and create software which in turn have the possibility to make our lives easier. I'm hopeful that by making the decision to go into coding, I can help bring new technologies to the world.
